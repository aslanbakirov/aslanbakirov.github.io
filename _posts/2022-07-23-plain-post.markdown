Recent several months, I have encountered and read papers, news, posts about advancements in in drug discovery, synthetic biology, CRIPS, protein folding (AlphaFold) etc. These are all fascinating improvements that would make world a better place to live. While reading the details, I noticed, I am lacking basic, fundamental biology knowledge in order to grasp the details. Therefore, I decided to invest some of my time to learn very basic components in genetics, and biology and share it with the people who are in the similar position. 
Since this post is 101 and also I dont know more yet, I will try to keep the post as simple as I can.

Genetics

What is Genetics?
Genetics is the field of science that examines how traits are passed from one generation to th next. 

What is Gene?
THe Genes are the segments of DNA(Deoxyribonucleic acid) that are the fundamental units of heredity.

Genetics is generally divided into four major subdivisions:
  - Classical or Mendelian genetics: A discipline that describes how physical characteristics (traits, a.k.a phenotypes) are passed along from one generation to another.
  - Molecular genetics: The study of the chemical and physical structures of DNA and its close cousin RNA (ribonucleic acid) and proteins. Molecular genetics also covers how genes do their jobs.  
  - Population genetics: A division of the genetics that looks at the genetic makeup of larger groups. Basically, it's a search for patterns that help describe the genetic signature of a particular group, such as consequences of migration, isolation from other populations, and mating choices. 
	- Evaluationary genetics: this is a type of population genetics that involves studying how traits change over time. 
  - Quantative genetics: A highly mathematical field that examines the statistical relationships between genes and the traits with which they are associated. One application of quantative genetics is determining how heritable a particular trait is. This measure allows scientists to make predictions about how offspring will turn out based on the characteristics of the parent organisms. 

Basic Cell Biology

There are two basic types of organisms distinguished by whether or not they have a *nucleus*. All living things fall into these two groups. 

**Prokaryotes:** Organisms whose cells lack a nuclesus and therefore have DNA floating loosely in the liquid center of the cell. 
**Eukaryotes:** Organisms that have a well-defined nucleus to house and protect DNA.
