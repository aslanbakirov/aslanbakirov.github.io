In this post, we will talk about what is the tensor, how it is stored in memory, and what reshaping operations we can apply on tensors. 

# Tensors
The tensor is the central data structure in Pytorch. Tensor is an n-dimensional data structure that contains some data in scalar type. Some of the types are boolean, integer and float. Imagine tensor as consisting of some data and some metadata describing its size/dimension, data type and where it is stored.
