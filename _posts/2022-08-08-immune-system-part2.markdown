*Note:* [The Immune System: Part I](https://aslanbakirov.github.io/2022/08/06/immune-system-part1.html) is prerequisite in order to understand this part better. We will refer to some of the terminologies and concepts defined in the previous  part.

In the first part, we learned some basic concepts about Immune System, what happens when a rusty nail penetrated your shoe and its tip entered to your big toe. Initially, Macrophages and Nutrophils goes to the battlefield and inflammation happens. In this part, we will dive deeper and try to understand how do cells know where to go, what are other killer armies of immune system and how they operate. 


# How Do Cells Know Where to Go?

How do cells know which way to go and where they are needed? To make this a bit more challenging, cells are blind, which makes sense if you think about it for a moment.
The process of seeing something requires light waves to hit the surface of an object and hit a sensory organ like your eye, where a few hundred million specialized cells transform them into electrical signals that are sent off to your brain for interpretation. This system is not available in a cell. Same goes for the "hearing", seeing and hearing in the sense humans are used to is not a great option in the microworld. So how cells experience their world? How do they communicate with each other?


Cells smell their way through life. For cells, information is a physical thing: **Cytokines**. In a nutshell, cytokines are very small proteins that are used to convey information. There are hundreds of diffirent cytokines and they are important in almost every biological process going on inside of you -- from your development in your mother's womb to the degeneration you experience as you get older. They are very important, in a sense cytokines are the language of your immune cells.


Lets say a Macrophage floats around and stumbles over an enemy. The discovery needs to be shared with other immune cells, so it releases cytokines that carry the information "Danger! Enemy around, come help out!". These cytokines then float away, carried purely by the random motion of particles in your bodily fluids. Somewhere else, another immune cell, maybe Neutrophil, smells these cytokines up and "receives" the information. The more cytokines it picks up, the stronger it reacts to them. But this is not all, the smell of cytokines also functions as a navigation system. The closer to the origin of the source of a smell is, the more cytokines it will pick up. By measuring the concentration of cytokines in the space aroun it, it can precisely locate where the message is coming from and then begin moving in that direction. It is sort of "smelling" where the smell is most intense. Which will lead it to the site of battle.


To do this, your immune cells dont have a single nose, they have millions of them, all over their bodies, covering their membranes en every direction. Why so many? For two reasons: First, by being covered by noses, cells have a 360 degress smell system, they can pretty precisely tell from which direction a cytokine is coming from. The another reason, it is good to have millions of noses to prevent cells from making mistake. Because your immune cells are blind and deaf and stupid, the have no way of asking questions. They dont know if a signal is real or if they interpreting it correctly. For example, a Neutrophil could pick up a cytokine that would be left over from an already won battle. Being wrong would be a waste of resources or could distract Neutrophil. The solution is not to rely  on one single nose but on many at the same time. This principle is very important. A signal needs to pass a specific threshold  to compel a cell to do something. 


We sort of have elegantly skipped over a question: How exactly do cytokines convey information and what does this mean? How does a protein tell a cell what to do? As we discussed before, cells are protein robots guided by biochemistry. The chemistry of life causes sequences of interactions between proteins that are called pathways. The action of pathways causes behaviour. In the case of cytokines, the information protein of the immune system, this happens through pathways that involve special structures called **receptors** on cell surfaces. They are the noses of your cells. 


In a nutshell, receptors are protein recognition machines that stick in the membrane of cells. A part of them is outside the cell and another part is inside the cell. Actually, about half of the surface of your cells is covered by myriads of diffirent receptors for all sorts of functions, from taking in certain nutrients to communicating with other cells or as triggers for a variety of behaviours. In a simplified way, receptors are sort of the sensory organs of cells that let the insides of the cells know what happened on the outside. A sequence of proteins interacting with each other that end up signalling the genes of the cell to be either more or less active.
