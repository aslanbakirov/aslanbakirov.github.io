Drug discovery and development is costly and time consuming process. For a new drug to get approved in US, it might take 10-15 years and cost around 1 billion dollars.
In this post, I go though overview of typical/traditional drug development pathway. These are the phases of drug development, however, each of them could have multiple stages.

1. Discovery and Development
2. Preclinical Research
3. Clinical Development
4. Regulatory Approval (FDA in US)
5. Post-Market Safety Monitoring
