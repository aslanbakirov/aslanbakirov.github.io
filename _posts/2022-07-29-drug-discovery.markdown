Drug discovery and development is costly and time consuming process. For a new drug to get approved in US, it might take 10-15 years and cost around 1 billion dollars.
In this post, I go though overview of typical/traditional drug development pathway. These are the phases of drug development, however, each of them could have multiple stages.

1. Discovery and Development
2. Preclinical Research
3. Clinical Development
4. Regulatory Approval (FDA in US)
5. Post-Market Safety Monitoring


# Early Discovery and Development
In this phase, researchers collaborate to identiy and optimize potential leads to a specific target.Essentially, the leads must elicit a desirable effect on a specific biological target implicated in a disase, in the hopes of treating it.
Let's get more in depth in the diffirent processes that occur during the early drug discovery. 

## Target Identification and Validation
One of the key factors in designing a good drug is having a crystal clear understanding of the pathogenesis of a disease. A suitable biological target is said to be "druggable" when a therapeutic molecule, called a  **"hit"**, can modify its biological activity. Potential **targets** can may be discovered by sourcing  available databases, and researching public literature. Target identification finds a gene or protein that plays a significant role in a disease. Afterwards, scientists and researchers record the target's therapeutic characteristics. Once target is identified, researchers validate their suitability for drug development. To validate targets, researchers use model tools and techniques such as disease association, bioactive molecules, cell-based models, protein interactions, signalling pathway analysis, antibodies and chemical genomics. For example, the Sanger Whole Genome CRISPER library and Duoling PLA are excellent sources for drug discovery targets. 


## High Throughput Screening (HTS)
HTS is often one of the most important steps towards discovering a drug. Once a potential target has been identified and validated, the starting point can be detected by screening a large of molecules that can interact with it. 

## Hit Identification and Discovery
To identify a hit molecule, various methods can be used. The hit is identified as a molecule that must interact with the previously mentioned target to result in a desired therapeutic effect. High Content Screening(HCS), phenotypic screening, fragment-based screening, structure-based screening and virtual screening are examples from large list of strategies used to discover hits.


## Assay Development and Screening
**Assays** are the test systems that evaluate the effects of the new drug candidate (hit) at the cellular, molecular and biochemical levels. Assay development is a crucial component of drug discovery workflow. High Content Screening uses robotics, data processing and sensitive detectors to rapidly conduct millions of pharmacological, chemical and genetic tests, eliminating hours of painstaking testing by scientists. HTS and HCS used to identify active compounds, genes or antibodies that affect human molecules.

## Hit-To-Lead (H2L)
As we mentioned earlier, a *hit* is a term used to describe a chemical compound that has a desired therapeutic effect at a known target molecule. Similarly, the *lead* is the product of the screening (HTS and HCS) process, which can be used in advanced stages. In other words, a hit is any compound that is confirmed to have binding activity to the targeta and a lead is a hit worth investigating further. A hit might not be worth investigating if it is poorly druggable or toxic or an artifact of the screen or has other problems.
