*Note:* [The Immune System: Part II](https://aslanbakirov.github.io/2022/08/08/immune-system-part2.html) is prerequisite in order to understand this part better. We will refer to some of the terminologies and concepts defined in the previous  part.


# The Murder University of the Thymus

The Adaptive Immune Cells have to graduate from: _The Murder University of the Thymus_. Your Thymus is absolutely crucial for your survival and, in a way, will decide at what age your will die, so you might think that it would be as well-known as liver, lungs or heart, but wierdly enough, most people are not even aware that they have this organ. 


Thymus is one of your most important immune cell universities (others include your bone marrow for your B cells, will explain later). Some of your most powerful, crucial adaptive immune cells are educated and trained here: **T Cells**. 


We met one group of T cells on the battlefield before, briefly, when they came rushing in to swing the battle, although we have not even begun to discover all their qualities. T Cells do a variety of things, from orchestrating other immune cells, to being antivirus superweapons, to killing cancer cells.  Without T Cells you are quite dead -- they may be the most important Adaptive Immune Cell you have. But before they can fight for you, they need to pass the horribly dangerous curriculum in the Thymus. Failing a test here means death.


_The Adaptive immune system is mixing gene segments to produce an amazing variety of diffirent receptors, able to connect to every possible protein, in this context called **antigens**, in the unvierse. This means that each individual T Cell is born with ONE specific type of receptor, able to recognize ONE specific antigen._ But there is a vital flow:  With so many diffirent receptors there are guaranteed to be a large number of T cells with receptors that are able to connect to proteins from your OWN cells. This is not a theoretical danger, but the cause of a number of very real and serious diseases that millions of people are suffering from right now called **autoimmune** diseases.
