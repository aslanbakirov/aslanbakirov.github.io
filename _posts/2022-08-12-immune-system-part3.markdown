*Note:* [The Immune System: Part II](https://aslanbakirov.github.io/2022/08/08/immune-system-part2.html) is prerequisite in order to understand this part better. We will refer to some of the terminologies and concepts defined in the previous  part.


# The Murder University of the Thymus

The Adaptive Immune Cells have to graduate from: _The Murder University of the Thymus_. Your Thymus is absolutely crucial for your survival and, in a way, will decide at what age your will die, so you might think that it would be as well-known as liver, lungs or heart, but wierdly enough, most people are not even aware that they have this organ. 


Thymus is one of your most important immune cell universities (others include your bone marrow for your B cells, will explain later). Some of your most powerful, crucial adaptive immune cells are educated and trained here: **T Cells**. 


We met one group of T cells on the battlefield before, briefly, when they came rushing in to swing the battle, although we have not even begun to discover all their qualities. T Cells do a variety of things, from orchestrating other immune cells, to being antivirus superweapons, to killing cancer cells.  Without T Cells you are quite dead -- they may be the most important Adaptive Immune Cell you have. But before they can fight for you, they need to pass the horribly dangerous curriculum in the Thymus. Failing a test here means death.


_The Adaptive immune system is mixing gene segments to produce an amazing variety of diffirent receptors, able to connect to every possible protein, in this context called **antigens**, in the unvierse. This means that each individual T Cell is born with ONE specific type of receptor, able to recognize ONE specific antigen._ But there is a vital flow:  With so many diffirent receptors there are guaranteed to be a large number of T cells with receptors that are able to connect to proteins from your OWN cells. This is not a theoretical danger, but the cause of a number of very real and serious diseases that millions of people are suffering from right now called **autoimmune** diseases.


For example, lets say a T Cell receptor can connect to a protein on the surface of a skin cell, it would not understand that it is connecting to a friend. It would just try to kill it. Or worse, since there are quite a lot of skin cells in the human body, it would think a large attack was going on with enemies everywhere, and alert the rest of the immune system to go into attack mode, and cause inflammation and all sorts of chaos. 


As you can imagine, the body takes this issue extemely seriously and came up with the Murder University of the Thymus to address it. After a fresh and young T cell has been born, it travels to the university and begins its training which consists of three steps, or better three tests:\
The first test is basically just making sure the T Cells have the ability to make working T Cell receptors (recetor is functional or not).\ 
The T Cells that pass test one have functional receptors. Great job so far! The second test is called  _positive selection_: Here the teacher cells check if the T cells are really good at recognizing the receptors of the cells they will need to work with.  Imagine this part as if the teacher is checking if the pens the students brought are full of ink. Once again, death is the punishment for failing second test.\
After two tests, the third test is _Negative selection_. The final exam is simply: Can the T cell recognize _self_?. Can its receptor connect to the main proteins inside the body? The only acceptable answer is "No, not at all".\
So in the final exam the T cells are presented with all sorts of protein combinations that are used by the cells of your body. The way this happens is pretty fascinating by the way -- the teach cells in the Thymus that do the testing have a special license to make all sorts of special proteins that usually are made only in organs like heart, pancreas, or the liver and also hormones, like insulin for example. This way they can show the T cell all kinds of proteins that are marked as  _"self"_. If a T Cell is able to recognize any of these self-proteins, then they are taken out back and shot in the head immediately. 


Unfortunately, yor Murder University is already in the process of shutting down. Your Thymus basically begins shrinking and withering away when you are a small child. Every year more Thymus cells turn into fat cells or just worthless tissue. The university closes more and more departments and gets worse as you age, until around the ripe age of eighty five, your T Cell uiversity closes its gates for good. 

# Antigen Presentation

When an infection occurs, your immune system determines which specific defense is needed and how much of it. The adaptive immune system works with Innate immune system to find the few cells that have the right receptors for this specific invasion, locate them among billions of others in your body, and then rapidly produce more of these cells. How does it do this? By preparing a _presentation_.\
Your Adaptive immune system does not make any real decisions about who to fight and when it is time to activate -- this is the Innate immune system's job, and this is where the Dentritic Cell comes into play. When an infection happens it covers itself with a selection of enemy's antigens and tries to find a Helper T cell that is able to recognize one of the antigens with its specific receptors. And this is exactly  the reason why the Dentritic cell is so crucially important. Without Dentritic cells, there would be no second line of defense. 


The first few hours of an infection, the Dentritic cell samples the battlefield and collects information about the enemy, which is a nice way of saying that it swallows enemies and disassemblies them into their parts, or _antigens_. The Dentritic Cell is an **antigen-presenting cell**.\
The Dentritic cell then travels through the lymphatic system to _present them to the Adaptive Immune System, or more precisely, to Helper T Cells_.\
An antigen-presenting cells have one more thing in common: A very special molecule that is as important Toll-Like Receptors, called **Major Histocompatibility Comlpex Class II**. Or in short, _MHC class II_. You can imagine the MHC class II receptor as a _hot dog bun_ that can be filled with a tasty _wiener_. The wiener in this metaphor is the antigen. 
 ![Antigen Representation](/assets/MHC.jpeg)
 

Helper T cells are able to recognize an antigen only if it is presented in an MHC class II molecule. This makes sure that Helper T Cells can not just get activated by accident because they pick up antigens that float around freely i the blood or lymph. They need to be presented with an antigen that sits in an MHC class II, from an antigen-presenting cell. 


So back to the battlefield, where soldiers are engaged in an epoc battle, Dentritic Cells awallow a cross section of everything floating around, including enemies. If they grab a bacterium they rip it into small pieces, antigens (wieners), and put them into MHC class II molecules (hot dog buns) that cover its outsides. Then the Dentritic Cell makes its way through the lymphatic system to the closest lymph node to look for a Helper T Cell. When a Helper T Cell happens to have the right T cell receptor, with just the right shape that recognizes the antigen in the MHC class II molecule, it will connect to it. This is pretty exciting moment, the Dentritic Cell atcually has found the right Helper T Cell out of billions. But it still NOT enough to activate Helper T Cell, a second signal is necessary, communicated by another set of receptors on both cells.\
This second signal is like a gentle kiss from the Dentritic Cell. It is another confirmation signal that clearly communicates again: "This is real, you are really properly activated!". Why is that so important tat we mention it here? This is another security mechanism that prevents Helper T Cells from activating accidentally -- only if a Dentritic Cell, that is representing Innate Immune System here, is activated by real danger is the Adaptive Immune System, represented by the Helper T Cell, supposed to activate. 


Dentritic Cells are snapshots of a battlefield in a moment in time. Once one leaves, it stops sampling and is locked in. After arriving in a Lymph Node, the Dentritic Cell has about a week to find a T Cell to activate before an internal timer runs out and it kills itself, as so many immune cells do. Basically, by sending fresh snapshots or newspapers, every few hours and eventually deleting them, your immune system collects and delivers a constant stream of fresh information about the battlefield. By deleting it regularly it makes sure not to operate on old information. 

# Awakening the Adaptive Immune System: T Cells

In this section, we will talk about T Cells classes and their details.\
T Cells have a much more varied set of jobs than the Macrophages or Neutrophils we got to know earlier. There are multiple classes of T Cells: _Helper T Cells, Killer T Cells, and Regulatory T Cells each able to specialize even more into various subclasses_, for every possible kind of infection.


T Cells are travellers that start their lives out in the bone marrow, where they mix and match the gene fragment that create their unique T Cell receptors, before they visit the Murder University of the Thymus to be educated. If the T Cell survive their education they move through your lymphatic megacity network, looking for an antigen that is exactly right and to get the encougaring kiss from a Dentritic Cell, to get activated.\ 
 

T Cells travel the whole of your lymphatic system once per day, so the chances of meeting exactly the right Dentritic Cell with matching antigen to the T cell receptor works out just fine. When this meeting happens the T Cell activates, and the hell breaks loose. \
For now we will just talk about the **Helper T Cell** to keep things simple, but we will get to know the classes of T Cells much more later on. We talked about the Helper T Cells already but now we are going to get a fuller picture.


The Helper T Cell can not stay alone if it wants to help beat back the infection, so its first job is to make more of itself. What we will pretty casually describe in the next two chapters is called the **_Clonal Selection Theory_**. The theory is basically goes like this:\
Your activated T Cell leaves the Dentritic Cell that activated it behind and wanders to a diffirent part of the Lymph Node where it begins the process of cloning itself. It divided over and over again, multiplying as fast as it can. Withing hours there are thousands of them. Because each of the clones has the same unique T Cell receptor like the first Helper T Cell that got activated, your immune system now has thousands of cells with this unique receptor.\
Once enough clones have been made, the individual cells split into two groups: Let us follow the first group now, we will come back to the second one later! They need a moment to orient themselves and take a deep sniff of cytokines and danger signals that have been carried by the lymph to the lymph node, and then they follow the chemical track to the battlefield as quickly as they can.\
Around five days to a week after the wound was inflicted Helper T Cells arrive at the site of infection. They act as commanders and play the role of amplifiers. Helper T Cells do not just put the Macrophages into Killer mode, and keep them alive. Helper T Cells can reset Macrophages suicide timer over and over again, as long as danger is present, they will tell your exhausted warriors to carry on by restimulating them over and over again. \
When the battle won, the last thing most Helper T Cells do at the battlefield is to kill themselves, except a few dont. Some Helper T Cells become **Memory Helper T Cells**. Whenever you hear that you are immune to a disease, this is what this means. It means that you have living memory cells that remember a specific enemy. And that enemy might come back, so they stick around and become powerful guardians. Memory Cells are able to recognize a familiar enemy much quicker than the Innate Immune System ever could. In case of another infection, this maes the long trip of the Dentritic Cell to the lymph node unnecessary because these Memory Helper T Cells can immediately activate and call for heavy reinforcements.


Remember we followed only one group from the lymph node to the battlefield. There was a second group that remained and what they are about to do might be even more important: Activating some of your most immune weapons. The mighty **B Cells**, your living weapon factories.
