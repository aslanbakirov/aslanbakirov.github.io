Today, I would like to talk about DNA replication in thousand meters bird's eye view. There are a lot of invaluable resources regarding this topic. I just want to summarise the steps and main terminologies, as if taking some notes in order to refer later.
Here are the steps for DNA-replication:

 **1. Replication Fork Formation (a.k.a Initiation)**
 

We form fork here
 2. **Primer Binding**
 bindig
 3. **Elongation**
  qqa
 4. Termination

All the steps with mentioned terminologies are show in the fascinating figure below.
