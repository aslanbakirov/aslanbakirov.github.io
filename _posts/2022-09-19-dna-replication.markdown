Today, I would like to talk about DNA replication in thousand meters bird's eye view. There are a lot of invaluable resources regarding this topic. I just want to summarise the steps and main terminologies, as if taking some notes in order to refer later.
Here are the steps for DNA-replication:

 **1. Replication Fork Formation (a.k.a Initiation)**
 
   This step can be seen as a preparation for the replication. Since DNA is in double stranded form, it must be "unzipped" first into two single strand in order to start replication. First thing first, the interactions between base pairs must be broken. This is performed by an enzyme called _DNA helicase_. This enzyme breaks the hydrogen bonding between base pairs to separate the strand into Y shaped known as _replication fork_.\
   DNA is directional in both strands, signified by a 5' (pronounced as five prime) and 3'(pronounced as three prime) end. This directionality is important for replication as it only progresses in 5' to 3' direction. After replication fork, on strand is oriented in the 3' to 5' direction, _leading strand_, and the other strand is oriented from 5' to 3' direction,  _lagging strand_. The two sides are therefore replicated with two diffirent processes to accomodate the directional diffirence.

 **2. Primer Binding**

   After DNA strands are separated, a short piece of RNA called a _primer_ binds to the 3' end of the strand. Primers are generated by the enzyme called _DNA primase_.

 **3. Elongation**
  
   Enzymes known as _DNA polymerases_ are responsible creating new strand by a process called elongation. DNA polymerase adds pieces of DNA called _Okazaki fragments_ to the strand between primers.   

 4. Termination

    
 
All the steps with mentioned terminologies are show in the fascinating figure below.
