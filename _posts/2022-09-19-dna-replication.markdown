Today, I would like to talk about DNA replication in thousand meters bird's eye view. There are a lot of invaluable resources regarding this topic. I just want to summarise the steps and main terminologies, as if taking some notes in order to refer later.
Here are the steps for DNA-replication:

 **1. Replication Fork Formation (a.k.a Initiation)**
 
   This step can be seen as a preparation for the replication. Since DNA is in double stranded form, it must be "unzipped" first into two single strand in order to start replication. First thing first, the interactions between base pairs must be broken. This is performed by an enzyme called _DNA helicase_. This enzyme breaks the hydrogen bonding between base pairs to separate the strand into Y shaped known as _replication fork_.


 2. **Primer Binding**

 3. **Elongation**

 4. Termination

All the steps with mentioned terminologies are show in the fascinating figure below.
