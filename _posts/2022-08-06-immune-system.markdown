*Note and Disclaimer:* This post is just braindump of mine after spending some time reading about human immune system. The topic itself is huge and much more complicated. Tried to keep it as simple as possible, using some analogies. Very much inspired from the book "Immune" by Philipp Dettmer. In addition, this post assumes that the reader possess high level information about basic cell biology and genetics, including DNA, proteins and cell structure (if not, please refer to my other posts about them). We will be focusing on human immune system. 

# What is the Immune System?

TL;DR: Immune system is the defense mechanism of your body to protect you from bacteria  or viruses or malfunctioning cells or organisms. 


Your immune system is not really inside you, *it is you*. It is an expression of your biology protecting itself and making your life possible. But your immune system is not a singular thing. It is a complex and interconnected collection of hundreds of bases and recruitment centers all over your body. They are connected by a superhighway, a network of vessels, similarly vast and omnipotent as your cardiovascular system. 
On top of organs and infrastructure, dozens of billions of immune cells patrol either these superhighways or your bloodstream and are ready to engage your enemies when called. Billions more sit guard in the tissue of your body that borders your outsides waiting for invaders to cross them. On top of your active defenses you have other defense systems made up of quintrillions of protein weapons that you can think of as self-assembling, free floating land mines. Your immune system also has dedicated universities where cells learn who to fight and how, also possess something like the largest biological library in the universe, able to identify and remember every possible invader. (We will talk about this university and library in detail, later)


At its core, the immune system is a tool to distinguish the **other** from the **self**. It does not matter if the other means to harm you or not. If the other is not on a very exclusive guest list that grants free passage, it has to be attacked and destroyed because the other might harm you. While identifying what is self and what is other is the *core*, it is not technically the goal of your immune system. The goal above all things is maintaining and establishing *__homeostatis__*: the equilibrium between all the elements and cells in the body. Something that can't be overemphasized enough about the immune system is how much it tries to be balanced and how much care it puts into calming itself down and not overreacting. Basically, for the immune system being healthy, the absence of suffering and pain, the absence of limitations and having pleasant life is homeostatis.


To summarize, distinguishing between self and other is core, homeostatis is the goal, and there are seemingly infinite ways for it to all go wrong. What make immune system so fascinating is that all this complex work has to be done by parts that are mindless and, individually, pretty dumb.
 
# What is there to defend?

Your body is perfect safe place with lots of "food" for bacteria, viruses and parasites, that is why they would like to "enter" and live there (Why, reason comes from evalution). The cells of your immune system are tasked to defend all of your body. Especially, the weak points where intruders can enter it, which is mostly the borders, the outside of your body. When you think about outsides, the first thing comes to mind is of source, your skin. Luckily, it is not that hard to defend, since most of it is made out of a hard, thick barrier covered with its own defense system. It feels soft, but it is pretty hard to breach if it is intact. Your real weak points to infections are your mucous membrane--the surface that lines your windpupe and lungs, eyelids, mouth and nose, your stomach and intestines, your reproductive tracts and bladder. 

Literally billions of parasites are trying to get inside. Some of them are bigger than the others. Mostly, they want to steal the *food* and make your body their permenant home to raise generations of their offspring. 

# Types of immune system
Lets very briefly define two types of your Immune system (we will dive a lot dipper, later in this post): **Innate Immune System** and **Adaptive Immune System**

## Innate Immune System
Innate Immune system contains all the defenses you are born with, and that can be employed mere seconds after the invasion occurs. One of its most central features is that it is the sort of smart part of your immune system. It has the power to tell/distinguish *self* from *other*. And once it detects *other* it immediately springs into action. However, its weapons are not tailored to identify any specific enemy, but instead they try to be effective accross a wide range of common enemies. It doesn't have specific weapons against specific types of *E.coli* bacteria, for example, but against bacteria in general. Think of it like your basic starter kit: it has all fundamentals, not the specialised items you would get with an advanced it. 

Without your Innate immune system, you would be overwhelmed and killed by microorganisms within days or weeks. Your innate immune system has to make crucial decisions at danger:

 - How dangerous an invasion?
 - What kind of enemy is attacking?
 - Are more heavy weapons necessary?

These decisions are vital, because they influence what sort of weapons your immune system as a whole will deploy. A bacterial invasion needs a different response than a viral invasion. So while fight is going on, the Innate Immune System gathers data and then it makes the decisions that in many cases will decide your fate. If your innate immune system think an attack is serious enough, it has the power to activate and call second line of defense and join them to the fight.

## Adaptive Immune System

The realm of Adaptive Immune system contains specialised super cells that coordinate and support your first line of defense. It contains factories that produce heavy protein weapons, and special cells that hunt and kill infected body cells in the case of viral infection. Its defining feature is that it is *specific*. Your adaptive immune system "knows" every possible intruder, has a specific answer for every possible microorganism that exists on this planet right now. We will talk in detail later in this post about this fascinating specific defense and how it works, but for now, just remember that your Adaptive immune system possesses largest library in the known universe, with an entry for every current and future possible enemy. 


In contrast to Innate immune system, your adaptive immune system is not ready yet when you are born. It needs to be trained and refined over many years. It starts as blank slate, and then gets progressively more powerful, only to get weaker as you age. A weak adaptive immune system is one of the main reasons young and old humans are often much more likely to die from diseases than people in the middle of their lives. Mothers actually lend their newborn babies a bit of their adaptive immunity in their mother's milk to help them survive and give them some protection.
