*Note and Disclaimer:* This post is just braindump of mine after spending some time reading about human immune system. The topic itself is huge and much more complicated. Tried to keep it as simple as possible, using some analogies. Very much inspired from the book "Immune" by Philipp Dettmer. In addition, this post assumes that the reader possesses high level information about basic cell biology and genetics, including DNA, proteins and cell structure (if not, please refer to my other posts about them). We will be focusing on human immune system. 

# What is the Immune System?

TL;DR: Immune system is the defense mechanism of your body to protect you from bacteria  or viruses or malfunctioning cells or organisms. 


Your immune system is not really inside you, *it is you*. It is an expression of your biology protecting itself and making your life possible. But your immune system is not a singular thing. It is a complex and interconnected collection of hundreds of bases and recruitment centers all over your body. They are connected by a superhighway, a network of vessels, similarly vast and omnipotent as your cardiovascular system. 
On top of organs and infrastructure, dozens of billions of immune cells patrol either these superhighways or your bloodstream and are ready to engage your enemies when called. Billions more sit guard in the tissue of your body that borders your outsides waiting for invaders to cross them. On top of your active defenses you have other defense systems made up of quintrillions of protein weapons that you can think of as self-assembling, free floating land mines. Your immune system also has dedicated universities where cells learn who to fight and how, also possess something like the largest biological library in the universe, able to identify and remember every possible invader. (We will talk about this university and library in detail, later)


At its core, the immune system is a tool to distinguish the **other** from the **self**. It does not matter if the other means to harm you or not. If the other is not on a very exclusive guest list that grants free passage, it has to be attacked and destroyed because the other might harm you. While identifying what is self and what is other is the *core*, it is not technically the goal of your immune system. The goal above all things is maintaining and establishing *__homeostatis__*: the equilibrium between all the elements and cells in the body. Something that can't be overemphasized enough about the immune system is how much it tries to be balanced and how much care it puts into calming itself down and not overreacting. Basically, for the immune system being healthy, the absence of suffering and pain, the absence of limitations and having pleasant life is homeostatis.


To summarize, distinguishing between self and other is core, homeostatis is the goal, and there are seemingly infinite ways for it to all go wrong. What make immune system so fascinating is that all this complex work has to be done by parts that are mindless and, individually, pretty dumb.
 
# What is there to defend?

Your body is perfect safe place with lots of "food" for bacteria, viruses and parasites, that is why they would like to "enter" and live there (Why, reason comes from evalution). The cells of your immune system are tasked to defend all of your body. Especially, the weak points where intruders can enter it, which is mostly the borders, the outside of your body. When you think about outsides, the first thing comes to mind is of source, your skin. Luckily, it is not that hard to defend, since most of it is made out of a hard, thick barrier covered with its own defense system. It feels soft, but it is pretty hard to breach if it is intact. Your real weak points to infections are your mucous membrane--the surface that lines your windpupe and lungs, eyelids, mouth and nose, your stomach and intestines, your reproductive tracts and bladder. 

Literally billions of parasites are trying to get inside. Some of them are bigger than the others. Mostly, they want to steal the *food* and make your body their permenant home to raise generations of their offspring. 

# Types of immune system
Lets very briefly define two types of your Immune system (we will dive a lot dipper, later in this post): **Innate Immune System** and **Adaptive Immune System**

### Innate Immune System
Innate Immune system contains all the defenses you are born with, and that can be employed mere seconds after the invasion occurs. One of its most central features is that it is the sort of smart part of your immune system. It has the power to tell/distinguish *self* from *other*. And once it detects *other* it immediately springs into action. However, its weapons are not tailored to identify any specific enemy, but instead they try to be effective accross a wide range of common enemies. It doesn't have specific weapons against specific types of *E.coli* bacteria, for example, but against bacteria in general. Think of it like your basic starter kit: it has all fundamentals, not the specialised items you would get with an advanced it. 

Without your Innate immune system, you would be overwhelmed and killed by microorganisms within days or weeks. Your innate immune system has to make crucial decisions at danger:

 - How dangerous an invasion?
 - What kind of enemy is attacking?
 - Are more heavy weapons necessary?

These decisions are vital, because they influence what sort of weapons your immune system as a whole will deploy. A bacterial invasion needs a different response than a viral invasion. So while fight is going on, the Innate Immune System gathers data and then it makes the decisions that in many cases will decide your fate. If your innate immune system think an attack is serious enough, it has the power to activate and call second line of defense and join them to the fight.

### Adaptive Immune System

The realm of Adaptive Immune system contains specialised super cells that coordinate and support your first line of defense. It contains factories that produce heavy protein weapons, and special cells that hunt and kill infected body cells in the case of viral infection. Its defining feature is that it is *specific*. Your adaptive immune system "knows" every possible intruder, has a specific answer for every possible microorganism that exists on this planet right now. We will talk in detail later in this post about this fascinating specific defense and how it works, but for now, just remember that your Adaptive immune system possesses largest library in the known universe, with an entry for every current and future possible enemy. 


In contrast to Innate immune system, your adaptive immune system is not ready yet when you are born. It needs to be trained and refined over many years. It starts as blank slate, and then gets progressively more powerful, only to get weaker as you age. A weak adaptive immune system is one of the main reasons young and old humans are often much more likely to die from diseases than people in the middle of their lives. Mothers actually lend their newborn babies a bit of their adaptive immunity in their mother's milk to help them survive and give them some protection. 

# Meet your Enemies

In modern world, when we are thinking of things that make us sick, we are mostly talking about bacteria or viruses. All sort of invader that is able to give your immune system a run for its money is called a **Pathogen** -- which means "the maker of suffering". So, every microorganism that causes disease is a pathogen, no matter what species, no matter how big or small. And almost everything can become a pathogen under the right circumstances. For example, a regular old bacteria living on your skin might not bother you at all, but can become a pathogen if you are going through chemotherapy and are immunocompromised, making it easy  to invade you. So whenever you read *pathogen*, just remember it means "a thing that makes you sick".

Your immune system is "aware" that there are very diffirent kinds of pathogens, that all require very diffirent responses to get rid of them. The well-known microorganism that your immune system has to deal with is **Bacteria**. Bacteria are single-celled protein robots that come in a wide variety of shapes and sizes and are guided by chemistry and their genetic code. Bacteria are masters of survival and can be found basically everywhere where nutrients are found. Bacteria saturate the soil you walk on, the surface of your desk, they float around in the air. 


In a pleasant environment,  a single bacterium can reproduce once every twenty to thirty minutes by dividing into two bacteria. So after four more ours of dividing, tere would be already 8000 of them.
There are a lot of unfriendly, pathogenic bacteria that try to invade your body and make you sick. They cause a wide an scary variety of diseases from diarrhea and all sorts of gut unpleasantries to tuberculosis or really scary things like the black plague, leprosy or syphilis. If they get the chance, they also use any opportunity to infect your flesh when you injury yourself and get your insides in touch with the environment where they exist, just everywhere. Even today with all the magic of modern medicine, the bacterial infections are responsible for a good chunk of deaths each year.


# The Skin as a defense layer
The life of your skin cells begins around one millimeter deep. Here, the Skin Industrial Complex is situated. In the *basal layer*, stem cells do nothing, but calmly multiply. They are cloning themselves, all day and night, producing new cells that begin a journey from the inside to the outside. The skin stem cells constantly make new skin cells, and each new generation pushes the older ones further up. So your skin cells are constantly pushed upward by younger skin cells emerging below them. The closer they get to the surface, the more the need to become ready to be living defenders. And so as your skin cells mature, they develop long spikes and interlock with the other cells around them to form a dense and impassable wall. Next your skin cells begin facturing lamellar bodies, tiny bags that squirt out fat to create a waterproof coat that covers the cells and the little bit of space that is left between them. The coat does three things: It acts as another physical border that is extremely hard to pass; it makes it easier to dispose of dead skin cell later on; and it is filled with natural antibiotics called *defensins*, which can straight up murder enemies on their own. 

As the skin cells are pushed up further towards the surface they begin preparing for the ir final job: Dying. They become flatter and bigger and begin to stick together even tighter until they merge together into inseparable clumps. And then they shed their water and kill themselves. You could say that the purpose of their life is to die in the right place and become neat carcasses. Up to fifty layers of dead cells, fused together on top of each other, form the dead part of your skin that ideally cover your whole body. 
Depending on your age, it takes your skin  between thirty and fifty days to completely turn over. Every single second, you shed around 40,000 dead skin cells.


When it is warm, humans sweat a lot, which both cools us and also transports a lot of salt to the surface. Most of it is reabsorbed but some of it remains, overall making your skin a pretty salty place, which many microbes dont like. As if that's not enoough, sweat contains even more natural antibiotics that can passively kill microbes.


But this is still not all. Another one of the great passive defenses of your skin is that it is covered in a very thin film of acid, appropriately called the **acid mantle**, which is s mixture of sweat and other substances secreted by glands below your skin. The acid mantle is not so harsh that it would hurt you, it just means that the pH of your skin is slightly low and therefore, slightly acidic that is something a lot of microorganisms dont like. The acid mantle has another great passive effect mostly geared towards bacteria: The inside and outside of your body have diffirent pH levels. So if a bacterium adapts to the acidic environment on your skin and then gets an opportunity to enter bloodstrea, for example, through an open wound, it has a problem: Your blood has a higher pH, so the bacterium suddenly finds itself in an environment that it is not adapted to, with very little time to do so, which is considerable challenge to some species. 

A healthy individual's skin holds up to forty diffirent bacteria species, as diffirent areas of your skin are drastically diffirent environments with their own specific climates and temperatures. Overall, an average square centimeter of your skin is home to around *a million bacteria*. 

# The Scenario of "The Cut"

In this part, we will describe the steps that are happening when you cut some part of your body. I will try to describe step by step for simplicity, however, the reality is much more complicated.
