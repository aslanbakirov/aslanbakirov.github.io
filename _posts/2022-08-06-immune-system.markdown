*Note and Disclaimer:* This post is just braindump of mine after spending some time reading about human immune system. Tried to keep it as simple as possible, using some analogies. Very much inspired from the book "Immune" by Philipp Dettmer. In addition, this post assumes that the reader possess high level information about basic cell biology and genetics, including DNA, proteins and cell structure (if not, please refer to my other posts about them). We will be focusing on human immune system. 

# What is the Immune System?

TL;DR: Immune system is the defense mechanism of your body to protect you from bacteria  or viruses or malfunctioning cells or organisms. 


Your immune system is not really inside you, *it is you*. It is an expression of your biology protecting itself and making your life possible. But your immune system is not a singular thing. It is a complex and interconnected collection of hundreds of bases and recruitment centers all over your body. They are connected by a superhighway, a network of vessels, similarly vast and omnipotent as your cardiovascular system. 
On top of organs and infrastructure, dozens of billions of immune cells patrol either these superhighways or your bloodstream and are ready to engage your enemies when called. Billions more sit guard in the tissue of your body that borders your outsides waiting for invaders to cross them. On top of your active defenses you have other defense systems made up of quintrillions of protein weapons that you can think of as self-assembling, free floating land mines. Your immune system also has dedicated universities where cells learn who to fight and how, also possess something like the largest biological library in the universe, able to identify and remember every possible invader. (We will talk about this university and library in detail, later)


At its core, the immune system is a tool to distinguish the **other** from the **self**. It does not matter if the other means to harm you or not. If the other is not on a very exclusive guest list that grants free passage, it has to be attacked and destroyed because the other might harm you. While identifying what is self and what is other is the *core*, it is not technically the goal of your immune system. The goal above all things is maintaining and establishing *__homeostatis__*: the equilibrium between all the elements and cells in the body. Something that can't be overemphasized enough about the immune system is how much it tries to be balanced and how much care it puts into calming itself down and not overreacting. Basically, for the immune system being healthy, the absence of suffering and pain, the absence of limitations and having pleasant life is homeostatis.


To summarize, distinguishing between self and other is core, homeostatis is the goal, and there are seemingly infinite ways for it to all go wrong. What make immune system so fascinating is that all this complex work has to be done by parts that are mindless and, individually, pretty dumb.
