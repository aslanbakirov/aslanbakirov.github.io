Neurotransmitters are chemical messengers in the body. They transmit signals from nerve cells to target cells. These target cells may be in muscles, glands or other nerves. These messages help you move your limbs, feel sensations, keep your heart beating and respond to all information your body receives from other internal parts of your body and your environment. 
Here are the short list of functions that your nervous system controls using neurotransmitters
 - Heartbeat and blood pressure
 - Breathing
 - Muscle movement
 - Memory, learning and feeling
 - Sleep, healing and aging
 - Stress management
 - Digestion and sense of hunger and thirst

  
Before we go into details, please check out this fascinating picture below, we will explore each part further in the next sections.

# How do neurotransmitters work?

Now, lets describe the picture mention above more in detail. You have billions of nerve cells in your body. Nerve cells are generally made up of three parts:

 - **A Cell Body:** The cell body is vital to producing neurotransmitters and maintaining the function of nerve cell.
 - **An Axon:** The axon carries the electrical signals along the nerve cell to the axon terminal. 
 - **An Axon Terminal:** This is where the electrical message is changed to a chemical signal (Really wonder how??) using neurotransmetters to communicate with the next group of nerve cells, muscle cells or organs.


Neurotransmitters are located in axon terminal, and are stored within thin-walled sacs called **synaptic vesicles.** Each vesicle can contain thousands of neurotransmitters.
As the signal travels along a nerve cell, the electrical charge of the signal causes the vesicles to fuse with the nerve cell membrane at the very edge of the cell. The neurotransmitters are then released from the axon terminal into a fluid-filled space that's between one nerve cell and the next target cell. In this space, which is called synaptic junction, each type of neurotransmitter lands on and binds to a specific receptor on the target cell. After they bind, in other words, deliver their message, the molecules must be cleared from the synaptic cleft/junction. They do this in one of the three ways.

 - Fade away, called as **diffusion** (b in the first picture)
 - Are reabsorbed and reused by the nerve cell that released it. This is called a **reuptake process** (a in the first picture)
 - Are broken down by enzymes wihtin the synapse so it can not be recognized or bind to receptor cell again. This process is called **degradation** (c in the first picture)

Even though the first pictures gives a lot of details, please check out the picture below which gives another perspective, as well.

# Classification of Neurotransmitters

Neurotransmitters can be classified under three categories based on the actions in their messages. 

 - **Excitatory:** These neurotransmitters "excite" the neuron and cause it to "fire off the message", meaning, message continues to passed along to the next cell. In addition, excitatory neurotransmitters encourage a target cell to take an action. Examples of these neurotransmitters are glutamate, epinephrine (a.k.a adrenaline), norepinephrine.
 - **Inhibitory:** 
 - **Modulatory:**
